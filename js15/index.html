    <!--
      Welcome to your first JavaScript exercise :)
      Here you will learn how to actually use what you have learned in the past few lessons.
      In this exercise you will learn how to build a basic calculator which includes knowledge you should have gotten from previous lessons on my channel.

      Bellow you will see a basic HTML form which we will use to collect the two numbers the user will submit and have calculated.
      The user will also have the ability to choose which mathmatical operation to perform on the two numbers.
    -->
    <h1>Awesome Calculator!!!</h1>
    <form>
      <!--
      Notice that each form element has an ID.
      We use these IDs to grab the form elements using JavaScript.
      -->
      Value 1: <input type="text" id="value1"><br>
      Value 2: <input type="text" id="value2"><br>
      Operation:
      <select id="operator">
        <option value="add">Add</option>
        <option value="sub">Subtract</option>
        <option value="div">Divide</option>
        <option value="mul">Multiply</option>
      </select><br>
      <!--
      In the button you will see a "onclick" attribute, which is what we call an event. Events are part of JavaScript and are used to "do something" on a website when a user interacts with an element. In this example when clicking an element. Once the element is clicked it will execute our calc() function in our JavaScript file.
      -->
      <button type="button" onclick="calc()">Calculate</button>
    </form>

    <!-- Here we output the result from the calculation. -->
    <div id="result"></div>
    
    <img src="math.jpg" alt="math" width="500" height="500">
